# Security Policy

`rust-auth-example` is a reference application for `bymax-auth` /
`@bymax-one/rust-auth`. It handles tokens, sessions, and credentials, so we treat
security reports as a first-class priority.

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported                |
| ------- | ------------------------ |
| 0.x     | ✅ latest line (pre-1.0) |

The latest released line receives security fixes; older lines are supported on a
best-effort basis, and any change is announced in the release notes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Please do not open a public issue, pull request, or discussion for a security
vulnerability** — public disclosure before a fix endangers every consumer.

Report it privately through either channel:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** — use _"Report a vulnerability"_ on the
  repository's **Security** tab (preferred — it lets us collaborate on a fix in a
  private fork).
- **Email** — the security contact is **support@bymax.one**.

Please include the affected surface (the Rust API or the browser package), the
version, a description and impact assessment, and a minimal reproduction where
possible.

## What to expect

- **Acknowledgement** within 3 business days.
- An initial assessment and severity rating within 7 business days.
- **Coordinated disclosure**: we agree on a timeline, ship a fix, publish an
  advisory, and **credit you** — unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
